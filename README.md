# react-scrollspy
Simple React scrollspy


# Usage

```html
<ScrollSpy targetSection = "scrollSection" 
           direction = "vertical" 
           nameSection = {['XXXX_GOld','VB','Carlin_Draught','Tooheys_New']}
           scrollDuration = "700">
```


### What's in it?

* Simple src/index.jsx and src/index.css (local module css).
* Webpack configuration for development (with hot reloading) and production (with minification).
* CSS module loading, so you can include your css by ```import styles from './path/to.css';```.
* Both js(x) and css hot loaded during development.
